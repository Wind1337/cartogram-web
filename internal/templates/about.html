       <h3>What are Cartograms?</h3>

       <p class="text-justify">Cartograms are maps in which the areas of regions (e.g. states, provinces) are rescaled to be
                proportional to statistical data (e.g. population size, gross domestic product). Cartograms are
                called “contiguous” if they maintain the topology of the conventional map (ie. regions are displayed
                as neighbours on the cartogram if and only If they are geographic neighbours) [1].</p>

        <p class="text-justify">
                Creating such cartograms has traditionally been a complex endeavour, one that usually only
                academics and experts attempt and explore. However, producing contiguous cartograms should
                not be the privilege of only a handful of experts in cartography. Journalists or bloggers, for
                example, may also benefit from a cartogram as an intriguing illustration of their own data.
                Similarly, high school students may enrich a term paper with a cartogram that can summarize
                data more e ectively than raw numeric tables.</p>

        <h3>Why go-cart.io?</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">Until now, the creation of contiguous cartograms has been far from user-friendly, requiring
                        computer skills that even experts in data visualization typically do not possess. In the past,
                        publications that introduced new cartogram algorithms rarely included computer code. Some
                        authors of more recent publications have posted their code online [1,2], but their software usually
                        requires technical knowledge (e.g. about shell scripting, compiling, GIS) that pose insurmountable
                        obstacles for most users. This is where go-cart.io comes in. With an interface that is easy for even
                        non-experts to use, go-cart.io eliminates hurdles and provides a convenient way to create readable
                        cartograms.</p>

        <h3>How Does go-cart.io Work?</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">While previous cartogram generators required users to install software (e.g. Java) on their
                        computer, go-cart.io is based on JavaScript that can be run in any contemporary web browser
                        without additional downloads. We decided to simplify the data input as much as possible. We have
                        curated a “library” of topologies so that users do not need GIS expertise to create geospatial
                        vector data. After data are transmitted, a remote server calculates the cartogram transformation
                        with the recently developed fast flow-based algorithm [1]. Because the calculation is entirely server-
                        side, we eliminate any dependence on the client’s hardware. For typical input, the calculation
                        finishes within 10 to 15 seconds. If the calculation needs substantially longer, the application
                        displays a bar chart instead of a cartogram as a fallback. The cartogram is displayed in the
                        browser window side by side with the conventional (i.e. equal-area) map. The user can
                        explore both maps with various interactive features implemented using the D3.js library [3].</p>
