# Cartogram Web Visualization Project

This project uses the cartogram generation algorithm written by Gastner et. al. in 2018 to create an interactive cartogram-generating website. The project consists of 4 main folders:

- `internal` contains all pages of cartogram web (e.g., home, cartogram, contact, etc.), written in python;
- `frontend` contains interactive features in a cartogram page, written using VueJs;
- `docs` contains documents;
- `data` contains data used to generate cartograms.

We recommend Docker for running this project. See https://github.com/go-cart-io/cartogram-docker.

To get the python website running locally on your computer, you may want to refer to the [Linux](docs/setup-ubuntu.md) or [Mac OS X](docs/setup-osx.md) setup guide. However, please note that the guide may not up-to-date. To add a map to the website, please follow the Add Map Wizard guide at [here](docs/addmap/addmap.md).
